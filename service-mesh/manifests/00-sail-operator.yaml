# The Sail Operator replaces servicemeshoperator in OSSM 3.
# It must be installed into openshift-operators (AllNamespaces watch).
# An OperatorGroup already exists there by default on OpenShift — we only
# need to create the Subscription.
#
# Package name: servicemeshoperator3  (OSSM 3 channel on Red Hat's catalog)
# If your cluster is disconnected, mirror this package with oc-mirror first.
